# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This repository contains all of the information required to complete the required analysis for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project. This project is based off of wearable analytics data retreived from The University of California at Irvine (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Smartphone-Based+Recognition+of+Human+Activities+and+Postural+Transitions).

This repository contains a Code Book that breaks down the analysis into a straight forward, easy to follow guide, as well as the code required to perform the given analysis in the run_analysis.R file.
